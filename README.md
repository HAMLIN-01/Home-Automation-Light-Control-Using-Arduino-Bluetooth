# Home-Automation-Light-Control-Using-Arduino-Bluetooth
This project demonstrates a simple home automation system where a light bulb can be turned on and off using a mobile app via Bluetooth. The system is built using an Arduino UNO and programmed in Embedded C using Arduino IDE. The simulation is done in Proteus.
# Features
Wireless control of a light bulb using a smartphone.
Uses the Arduino Bluetooth Controller app for easy operation.
Communicates via HC-05 Bluetooth module.
Simple and efficient design for home automation projects.
# Tools Used
Microcontroller: Arduino UNO,
Communication Module: HC-05 Bluetooth Module,
Programming Language: Embedded C,
IDE: Arduino IDE,
Simulation Software: Proteus.
# How It Works
The Arduino UNO is connected to an HC-05 Bluetooth module.
A light bulb (or LED) is connected through a relay module for control.
The Arduino Bluetooth Controller mobile app sends commands via Bluetooth.
The Arduino reads the received command and switches the light ON or OFF accordingly.
